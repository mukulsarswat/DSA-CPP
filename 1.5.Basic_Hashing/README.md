## ðŸ“– Introduction
**Hashing** is a technique used to **map data to a fixed-size structure** for fast retrieval.  
In **C++**, hashing is widely used in competitive programming and real-world applications such as **frequency counting, duplicate detection, and lookups**.

---

## âš¡ What is Hashing?
- Hashing uses a **hash function** to convert keys into indexes of a hash table.
- Provides **O(1)** average-time complexity for:
  - **Insertion**
  - **Deletion**
  - **Search**
- Makes it highly efficient compared to linear or binary search.

## ðŸŽ¯ Applications of Hashing
âœ… Counting frequencies of elements  
âœ… Checking duplicates efficiently  
âœ… Implementing `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`  
âœ… Cryptography & password storage (advanced use)

## ðŸ’» Implementation in C++

### ðŸ“Œ Example 1: Counting Frequencies in an Array
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2};
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;

    for (int num : arr) {
        freq[num]++;
    }

    cout << "Frequencies:\n";
    for (auto &p : freq) {
        cout << p.first << " -> " << p.second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
