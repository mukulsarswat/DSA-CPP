## Introduction

C++ is a powerful high-level programming language offering both procedural and object-oriented features. The Standard Template Library (STL) is one of C++'s standout features, providing a rich set of ready-to-use classes and functions for data structures and algorithms.

---

## What is STL?

The **Standard Template Library** is a collection of template classes and functions that provide commonly used data structures and algorithms. STL enables developers to write more efficient and reusable code, allowing focus on solving problems rather than implementing basic data structures from scratch.

## Major Components of STL

### 1. Containers

Containers are objects that store data. STL provides several types of containers, such as:

- **Sequence Containers**: `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `array`, `forward_list`
- **Associative Containers**: `set`, `map`, `multiset`, `multimap`
- **Unordered Containers**: `unordered_set`, `unordered_map`, `unordered_multiset`, `unordered_multimap`
- **Container Adapters**: `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`

### 2. Iterators

Iterators are objects that point to elements within containers. They work similarly to pointers and allow traversal of container elements.

- Types: `begin()`, `end()`, `rbegin()`, `rend()`, `cbegin()`, `cend()`, etc.

### 3. Algorithms

STL provides many built-in algorithms, such as sorting, searching, reversing, counting, etc., which can be used on containers.

- Examples: `sort()`, `find()`, `reverse()`, `accumulate()`, `count()`, `binary_search()`, etc.

### 4. Functors

Functors (Function Objects) are objects that can be called as if they are functions. They can be used for customizing the behavior of STL algorithms.

## Tips & Important Points in C++

1. **Prefer STL containers over raw arrays and pointers** for safety and easier code management.
2. **Use auto keyword** with iterators and complex types for cleaner code.
3. **Pass containers by reference** to avoid unnecessary copying.
4. **Always check for iterator validity.**
5. **Use range-based for loops** for better readability.
6. **Leverage built-in STL algorithms** rather than writing custom loops.
7. **Understand time complexity** of STL operations for optimal performance.
8. **Use `const` wherever possible** for safer code.
9. **Remember to include relevant headers** for each STL component.
10. **Be cautious with iterator invalidation** after insertions or deletions in containers.

## Sample Code Snippets

### Using a Vector

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    v.push_back(6);
    for(auto x : v)
        cout << x << " ";
    return 0;
}
```

### Sorting a Vector

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

vector<int> nums = {4, 2, 8, 5, 1};
sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // Ascending order
```

### Map Example

```cpp
#include <map>
map<string, int> age;
age["Alice"] = 22;
age["Bob"] = 25;
```

### Custom Comparator in Sort

```cpp
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int a, int b) { return a > b; }); // Descending
```
