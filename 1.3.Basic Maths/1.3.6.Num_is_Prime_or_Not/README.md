## Solution 
1. Using Naive approach using Trial method. [Solution](./Naive_Approach.cpp)  TC: O(n) and O(1) Space.
2. Using Trial Division Method  But Optimising it. [Solution](./Optimised_Approach.cpp) .  TC: O(sqrt(n))  and O(1) Space.
3. Optimized Trial Division Method  [Best Solution](./Best_Approach.cpp) . TC:  O(sqrt(n)) Time and O(1) Space.
