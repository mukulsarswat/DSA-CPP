## Problem Statement 
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

## <i> What is [Palindrome Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number) </i> 

## Examples    
Example 1:
      Input: x = 121
      Output: true
      Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
      Input: x = -121
      Output: false
      Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
