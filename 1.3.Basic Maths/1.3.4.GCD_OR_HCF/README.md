## Problem Statement  
Write a program to find the [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor) of two numbers.

## Examples  
Input: a = 12, b = 18  
Output: 6  
Explanation: 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18.

Input: a = 100, b = 25  
Output: 25  
Explanation: 25 is the highest number that divides both 100 and 25.

Input: a = 7, b = 13  
Output: 1  
Explanation: 7 and 13 are co-prime, so their GCD is 1.

## Solution  
1. Using Euclidean Algorithm (Iterative). [Solution](./Euclidean_Iterative_Solution.cpp)  
2. Using Euclidean Algorithm (Recursive). [Solution](./Euclidean_Recursive_Solution.cpp)  
3. By Prime Factorization (Less Efficient). [Solution](./Prime_Factorization_Solution.cpp) Extension of the solution returns all factors.
