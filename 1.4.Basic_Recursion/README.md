# 🔁 Basic Recursion in Programming

## 📘 Overview
Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It’s widely used in algorithms involving divide-and-conquer, backtracking, and tree traversal.

This project introduces the **core principles of recursion**, demonstrates simple recursive functions, and visualizes how the call stack behaves during execution.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how recursion works and when to use it.
- Implement basic recursive functions like factorial, Fibonacci,[palindrome](./1.4.3.Palindrome_String) and [sum of digits](./1.4.2.sum_of_first_N.cpp).
- Visualize the recursive call stack and return path.
- Compare recursion with iterative approaches.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Concept            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Base Case**      | The condition under which recursion stops. Prevents infinite calls.         |
| **Recursive Case** | The part of the function where it calls itself with a smaller input.        |
| **Call Stack**     | A system-managed structure that tracks active function calls and returns.   |
